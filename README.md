# Digits Classification Neural Network

#INFO

1. After researching the math behind neural networks, I created my own
2. The data used was a dataset which has both fake digits and real, handwritten one
3. The program uses a sigmoid function in order to classify the data.
4. Once all epochs are finished, the accuracy will be printed, while a pyplot graph will show the results graphically. 

#How to run the code

1. Extract 'train-images.rar' into the same folder as all the other code.
2. Close whatever code you have open on your respective IDE.
3. Open the folder containing the data/code.
4. Press run on the code and wait.
